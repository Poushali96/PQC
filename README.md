# Adaptive Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for 6G V2X Networks  
### Reproducible Implementation for FutureG/NDSS Workshop Submission

This repository contains a fully reproducible Python implementation of our adaptive Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) framework for 6G vehicular networks. The system integrates real ERA5 weather data, LuST-style mobility traces, dynamic 3GPP channel simulation, and an evolutionary optimizer (APMOEA) to select PQC algorithms based on context.

The implementation accompanies our workshop paper:

> **Adaptive PQC for 6G Vehicular Networks: Context-Aware Optimization and Monotonic Security Upgrades**  
> (FutureG / NDSS Workshop Submission)

## 🔍 Overview

Modern V2X systems face rapidly varying conditions:
- fluctuating SNR  
- mobility and acceleration  
- CPU and hardware constraints  
- congestion and environmental effects  

Traditional “static PQC” approaches are unsafe or wasteful.  
This repository implements an **adaptive, predictive, and downgrade-resistant PQC selection engine** that responds to real-time context.

The pipeline produces:
- **Stable PQC transitions** (no rollbacks)  
- **Smooth decision boundaries** (proved in paper)  
- **Model explainability** via SHAP  
- **3D feature-space visualizations**  
- **Secure, monotonic version upgrades**

---

## 📦 Features

### ✔ Real-world context integration
- Hourly **ERA5 weather** (temperature, pressure, wind)
- 10-second **LuST-style mobility traces**
- **3GPP TR 38.885** fading-based SNR evolution
- Dynamic **CPU load** model for 800MHz automotive ECUs

### ✔ PQC-aware adaptive optimization
- Supports **Kyber768, Dilithium3, McEliece, SPHINCS+**
- Risk-aware cost model (latency + comm + security + compute)
- Extreme-risk mode enabling high-security PQC under bad channels
- APMOEA-style prediction + optimization loop

### ✔ Secure transition protocol
- Version counters  
- Context hashes  
- Nonces  
- Monotonic upgrade rule (no downgrade under risk)

### ✔ Visualizations
- **SHAP interaction plots** explaining the model  
- **3D PQC selection landscape**  
- **Time-series plot of SNR vs. chosen PQC**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Major libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* shap
* xarray
* h5netcdf
* cdsapi

### 3. Run the main pipeline

Either inside Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook PQC.ipynb
```

Or with a cleaned `.py` script:

```bash
python reproducibility.py
```

---

## 📊 Outputs

Running the pipeline generates:

### **1. SNR vs. PQC transition timeline**

Shows when and why the system upgrades PQC.

### **2. SHAP interaction matrix**

Explains feature interactions (latency × mobility × compute).

### **3. 3D PQC selection space**

Visualizes clusters for Kyber, Dilithium, McEliece, SPHINCS+.

## 🔒 Security Model

The implementation includes:

* authenticated PQC version counters
* nonce-based freshness checks
* context-integrity hashes
* strict monotonic upgrade (no rollback under risk)

All simulated adversarial attempts (replay, rollback, desync) are rejected.

---

## 📄 Reproducibility

This repository follows the reproducibility practices described in the paper:

* All data are public or synthetic
* ERA5 files included (or downloadable)
* Random seeds fixed (`np.random.seed(42)`)
* All plots and tables regenerated by a single run
